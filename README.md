# web-scraping-challenge

## Purpose of Project
In this assignment, you will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following information outlines what you need to do.

### Part 1: Scraping
Complete the initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.
-Create a Jupyter Notebook file called mission_to_mars.ipynb. Use this file to complete all scraping and analysis tasks. The following information outlines what is going to be scraped.
#### NASA Mars News
-Scrape the Mars News Site and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text.
#### JPL Mars Space Imagesâ€”Featured Image
-Visit the URL for the Featured Space Image site here.
-Use Splinter to navigate the site and find the image URL for the current Featured Mars Image, then assign the URL string to a variable called featured_image_url.
#### Mars Facts
-Visit the Mars Facts webpage and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet (compare to earth) including diameter, mass, etc.
-Use Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string (to save into MongoDB later on).
#### Mars Hemispheres
-Visit the astrogeology site to obtain high-resolution images for each hemisphere of Mars.
-Click each of the links to the hemispheres in order to find the image URL to the full-resolution image.
-Save the image URL string for the full resolution hemisphere image and the hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. Use a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys img_url and title.
-Append the dictionary with the image URL string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list contains one dictionary for each hemisphere.

### Part 2: MongoDB and Flask Application
Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all the information that was scraped from the URLs above.
-Start by converting the Jupyter notebook into a Python script called scrape_mars.py by using a function called scrape. This function should execute all your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all the scraped data.
-Next, create a route called /scrape that will import your scrape_mars.py script and call your scrape function.
-Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.
Create a root route / that will query Mongo database and pass the Mars data into an HTML template for displaying the data.
-Create a template HTML file called index.html that will take the Mars data dictionary and display all the data in the appropriate HTML elements.

## Results
After writing app.py and index.html, I was able to get web page.
